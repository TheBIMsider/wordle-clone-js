# Wordle-Clone

My attempt at a wordle clone based on the [Code with Ania Kubów](https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w) YouTube video ["Wordle Clone in JavaScript!"](https://youtu.be/mpby4HiElek) created by [Ania Kubów](https://github.com/kubowania).

I worked through this video which is about 90 minute long. I spent about 6 - 8 hours to get my version of what Ania did working, but in the end it worked just like she showed on the video. The Wordle Clone from the video uses 2 APIs to get the the words and check them with a dictionary. To learn more about this its best to watch the video or check out the GitHub repository for Ania's code for the project [HERE](https://github.com/kubowania/wordle-javascript) (wordle-javascript). You can check my version of the code in the folder "Wordle_Clone" in this repository. I really enjoyed learning about connecting the APIs and building my first, very simple backend to make it all work.

After doing the API version of the Wordle clone I wanted to see if I could do a version that didn't need the APIs. When working on this I found a couple other wordle tutorials on YouTube that helped with a few things to change it from with APIs to without.
