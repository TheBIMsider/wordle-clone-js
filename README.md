# Wordle-Clone

My attempt at a wordle clone based on the [Code with Ania Kubów](https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w) YouTube video ["Wordle Clone in JavaScript!"](https://youtu.be/mpby4HiElek) created by [Ania Kubów].(https://github.com/kubowania)

I worked through this video which is about 90 minute long. I spent about 6 - 8 hours to get my version of what Ania did working, but in the end it worked just like she showed on the video. The Wordle Clone from the video uses 2 API's to get the the words and check them with a dictionary. To learn more about this its best to watch the video or check out the GitHub repository for Ania's code for the project [HERE](https://github.com/kubowania/wordle-javascript) (wordle-javascript)
