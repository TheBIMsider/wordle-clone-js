# Wordle-Clone

My attempt at a Wordle Clone based on the [Code with Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w) YouTube video ["Wordle Clone in JavaScript!"](https://youtu.be/mpby4HiElek) created by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://github.com/kubowania).

I worked through this video which is about 90 minute longs. I spent about 6 - 8 hours to get my version of what Ania did working, but in the end it worked just like she showed on the video. The Wordle Clone from the video uses 2 APIs to get the the words and check them with a dictionary. To learn more about this it's best to watch the video or check out the GitHub repo for Ania's project code [HERE](https://github.com/kubowania/wordle-javascript) (wordle-javascript). You can check my version of the code in the folder "Wordle_Clone" in this repository. I really enjoyed learning about connecting the APIs and building my first, very simple, backend to make it all work.

After doing the API version of the Wordle Clone I wanted to see if I could do a version that didn't need the APIs. When working on this I found a couple other Wordle Clone tutorials on YouTube that helped with a few things to change it from with APIs to without.

- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) YouTube video: [How To Create A 7 Figure Business Idea In One Hour](https://youtu.be/Wak7iN4JZzU) GitHub Repo [Here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wordle-clone)
- [Ian Lenehan](https://www.youtube.com/c/IanLenehan) YouTube video: [Using a Wordle clone to understand local storage in Javascript](https://youtu.be/lF4O1wvyVow) GitHub Repo [Here](https://github.com/ianlenehan/wordle-clone)

I also used a few sites/tools to help curate the words used to be the "Wordles", and the dictionary to check the words:
- [Randon Word Generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/)
- [KITTXT](https://kittxt.com/eng/) online kit for text and lists.
- [arrayThis](https://arraythis.com/) instantly convert your text list to array; valid for JS, PHP, PERL, PYTHON (as list) and much more.

I ended up with three Wordle Clones versions, where the number is equal to the number of letters in the "Wordle". I figured the 3 letter version would be easier and the 7 letter version harder. I was part right, the 3 letter version is much harder than you think becasue you don't get many letters to help with your guesses.

Overall I would say the Clones I created are about 80 - 85% based on Ania's Tutorial, 5 - 10% based on the Web Dev Simplifide & Ian Lenehan Tutorials, and whatever's left I guess is on me üòÅ

# Update
I wanted to see if I could make the clones a little more responsive on phones, so I tried my 3, 5, and 7 letter versions based off the [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) version. Similar to the past versions my take is about 90% WDS and 10% me üòâ. Give the WDS versions a try below.    

# Try The Clones!

[Wordle Clone 3](https://thebimsider.github.io/wordle-clone-js/Wordle_Clone_3) the "Wordle" is 3 letters, and you have 6 guesses to get it. (originally only 4 guesses but way to hard)

[Wordle Clone 5](https://thebimsider.github.io/wordle-clone-js/Wordle_Clone_5) the "Wordle" is 5 letters, and you have 6 guesses to get it.   

[Wordle Clone 7](https://thebimsider.github.io/wordle-clone-js/Wordle_Clone_7) the "Wordle" is 7 letters, and you have 8 guesses to get it.   

[Wordle Clone WDS 3](https://thebimsider.github.io/wordle-clone-js/Wordle_Clone_WDS_3) the "Wordle" is 3 letters, and you have 6 guesses to get it. 

[Wordle Clone WDS 5](https://thebimsider.github.io/wordle-clone-js/Wordle_Clone_WDS_5) the "Wordle" is 5 letters, and you have 6 guesses to get it  

[Wordle Clone WDS 7](https://thebimsider.github.io/wordle-clone-js/Wordle_Clone_WDS_7) the "Wordle" is 7 letters, and you have 8 guesses to get it.   

All versions choose a random "Wordle" from a list of 350 words for that version of the Clone. You can play as many time as you like, but as a truly random selection for the Wordle you could get the same word back to back, or close together.
